A complete MATLAB toolbox was created to allow the automatic use of the SWAN wave simulation software with a variety of options, and allow automatic visualization of the results as well. This toolbox could be used by other students to make and run wave forecast for Lebanon.
Please contact me if you are interseted in that work.
